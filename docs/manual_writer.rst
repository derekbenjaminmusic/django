   Writer list view, note how lack of data influences ``can be controlled`` value.

Add/Change View
---------------

``Add`` and ``change`` views for writers have four field groups.

Name
++++

``Last name`` and ``first name`` fields in the first, quite self-explanatory.

IPI
+++

``IPI name #`` and ``IPI Base #`` in the second. If you are unfamiliar with these
identifiers, see `IPI <https://matijakolaric.com/articles/identifiers/ipi/>_`.

Societies
+++++++++

``Performance Rights Society`` in the third. Depending on settings,
societies for mechanical (and even synchronization rights) might appear in this group as well.
Note that in most cases, writers are only affiliated with performance rights societies.

General Agreement
+++++++++++++++++

In the last group, we have three fields:

* ``General agreement`` checkbox to mark that there is an original general agreement with this writer. This means that this writer must be controlled in all works.
* ``Society-assigned agreement number`` for the original general agreement between you and this writer (required in some societies)
* ``Publisher fee`` is the fee kept by the publisher when royalties are paid and distributed. **This field is not used in registrations.** It is used only for royalty statement processing. Most small publishers don't use it.

List View
---------

The ``list`` is quite self-explanatory, except the ``Can be controlled`` column.

For writers who are controlled (whose works are published by you), more data is required
than for those who are not. This column shows if data is sufficient for the writer to be
marked as controlled.

It is your responsibility to register not just your shares, but also theirs. Also, it is
your responsibility to advise them about becoming an affiliate of a collecting society.

If they choose not to become an affiliate of any performance rights society,
you can enter ``00000000000`` in the ``IPI name#`` field. This has to be
re-entered on *every* save. If they choose to become affiliate later on,
it is your responsibility to register the changes.

For writers you do not control, you should still provide as much data as possible.
Please note that if not all writers are identified with their IPI numbers,
the work may not receive an
`International Standard Musical Work Code (ISWC) <https://matijakolaric.com/articles/identifiers/iswc/>`_

The last column is both a work counter and link to the list of :doc:`works <manual_work>` by this writer.
