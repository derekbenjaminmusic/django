############

This manual is aimed at music publishing professionals. It explains how Django Music Publisher is used, but it does not explain how music publishing works.

This manual continues at the point where :ref:`StandaloneDeployment` ended, presuming that Django Music Publisher was installed, migrations performed, a superuser created, predefined permission groups added, and that Django Music Publisher is running.
