DMP Seminar
###################################

DMP is perfect for practical seminars about metadata management for music 
publishers, registrations and royalty management.

If you are hosting a seminar, you can provide DMP for each of the 
attendees. However, you will not be able to deploy more than 5
instances for free. And deploying many instances manually is a recipe
for disaster.

You can have attendees deploy DMP themselves, but that will be even worse.

There is a commercial alternative.


How does it work?
==========================================

Create your seminar in the control panel.

Upload a simple list of attendants with their:

* name (to be used for username), and
* publisher name

You will receive the same list, extended with additional
information (URLs, passwords, etc.)

Activate your seminar. Each attendee gets their own DMP instance 
deployed, with reasonably fool-proof permissions.

You will be able to log into all instances and monitor
attendee progress.

You are free to use this documentation in your own.
