DMP Seminar
###################################

DMP is perfect for practical seminars about metadata management for music 
publishers, registrations and royalty management.




How does it work?
==========================================

Create your seminar in the control panel.

Upload a simple list of attendants with their:

* name (to be used for username), and
* publisher name

You will receive the same list, extended with additional
information (URLs, passwords, etc.)

Each attendant gets their own DMP instance deployed, 
with reasonably fool-proof permissions.

You will be able to log into all instances, to monitor
attendants' progress.

You are free to use this documentation in your own.
