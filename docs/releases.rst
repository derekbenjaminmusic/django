Release Policy
##############

Django Music Publisher release policy defines how and when new versions are released, as well as their naming. We have major and minor releases. Major releases have two segments in version identifier, the year and the month of the release. It may also have a name. Current major release is **19.1 Epiphany**.

Minor releases have three segments, the first two are the same as the current major release, while the third is incremental numbering.

Major releases
==============

There are two reasons for a major release:

* Every two years, a new long term support (LTS) version of Django is released, in April of the odd year. There will be a new Django Music Publisher release three months later.

* When there are significant new features. Please note that new features of Django Music Publisher depend on sponsors.

Minor Releases
==============

Minor releases are bugfix/security releases.

They are released when a real security issue is detected in Django Music Publisher or any of the dependencies. Bugfix releases are released as bugs get fixed, the speed of it depends on the severity of a bug.
