Future Releases

Major releases
==============

The purpose of major releases is to keep up with projects and specifications Django Music Publisher depends on. Basically, this boils down to Django, Python and PostgreSQL versions, as well as CWR and DDEX specifications.

The plan is to have two major releases in 2019, and then one every two years, with Django LTS releases. This is due to the fact that CWR 3.0 is going to be released soon, as well as new DDEX versions. Also, MLC may come up with a new set of requirements in the next year, but once all of that is done, we will most likely return to the slow progress of the industry.

Minor Releases - Security and Bugfix
====================================

Minor releases are bugfix/security releases.

Security releases are released when a real security issue is detected in Django Music Publisher ot any of the dependencies. Bugfix releases are released as bugs get fixed, the speed of it depends on the severity of a bug.

Sponsored Releases
==================

If sufficient funding becomes available through sponsors, there will be a sponsored release with new features. Proposed new features are covered in the next section.
