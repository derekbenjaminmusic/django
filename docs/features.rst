======================================================= =========

Previous releases of Django Music Publisher used an external service for data validation, CWR generation and syntax highlighting. Django Music Publisher began as a proof of concept for this service. However, data validation and CWR generation are the most important features of Django Music Publisher.

Previous releases of Django Music Publisher had some limitations, inherited from the external CWR generation service it used. One such limitation was that it only allowed registration of original musical works, not modifications.

Also, the core royalty distribution has been implemented, please see next section for details.

Features still missing

Royalty Distribution Processing
-------------------------------

There are many different input formats, and they also come in different currencies with different conversion rates at different dates. However, much of the work can be done in Excel, once the basic distribution has been calculated.

The processing core has been added, but there is still a lot to do.

Please note that this feature will be a sub-project with a separate repository.

Data import
-----------

Current releases do not support data imports from third party software solutions or spreadsheet data. So far the maintainer has been providing this as a paid service. However, it would be in public interest if people would be able to do it themselves.

There are several caveats here, the first one is related to internal work numbering. If imported data was already used for registrations via CWR or EBR or any format that has submitter work IDs, then they must be maintained. However, Django Music Publisher creates it's own work IDs and adding custom ones will create several new potential issues.

Second one is that usual formats often contain more data then Django Music Publisher can hold, but it is not possible to calculate the shares back to initial distribution among writers.

The third issue is that often the input file does not contain all the data required for a minimal CWR, so the data can not pass the validation.

As long as data is imported from a custom spreadsheet or JSON format that does not have work IDs, the responsibility for these issues is not with the software. Within these boundaries, the cost estimates are:

========================================================= =========

MWN (DDEX)
----------

MWN is a format that has similar data structure to CWR, though the underlying format is completely different. It requires a licence to be used, from which it is quite unclear whether it is legally possible to integrate the functionality into an open source solution.

Implementing it is definitely cheaper than paying for a legal interpretation.

Recording-related data and other DDEX formats
---------------------------------------------

Same thing.


CWR Delivery service
--------------------

This is definitely something that would be very helpful. There are three issues here:

* every society and/or administrative agency uses a slightly different delivery system
* this requires some kind of background worker or at least a cron job, so it is a bit more complicated to deploy
* we are dealing with sensitive data here, bad deployments might easily result in security issues, data loss or worse.

The solution exists, but it is not going into the open source code in the foreseeable future.
