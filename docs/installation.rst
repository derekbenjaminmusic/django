Installation / Deployment and Configuration
*******************************************

Django-Music-Publisher (DMP) can be installed/deployed as a stand-alone application, or used as a Python package.

Standalone Deployment
=====================

Depending on your needs and technical knowledge, there are several options. They are listed below, starting with
the simplest option, which can be performed without any technical skills in under 5 minutes.

Deployment to Heroku (free tier)
--------------------------------

  Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps â€” we're the fastest way to go
  from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.

Django-Music-Publisher can simply be deployed to a *Free dyno* on Heroku with a free *Dev* database with up to
10.000 rows. Depending on complexity of your metadata, this is enough for up to 1.000 musical works.

.. note::
    With *Hobby Basic* database ($9 per month), the database limit raises to 10.000.000 rows, which should be more
    than enough for any user od DMP.
    See `Heroku prices <https://www.heroku.com/pricing>`_ for more information.

You will have to sign up with Heroku at https://signup.heroku.com/ and verify your e-mail,
no payment information is required.

There are two ways to do it:

* Guided deployment, which uses a wizard that helps you fill out the deployment form, and
* Direct deployment, which does not, but takes you directly to the deployment form.

Guided Deployment to Heroku
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The author and maintainer of Django-Music-Publisher provides a
`pre-installation wizard <https://matijakolaric.com/dmp-preinstallation/>`_,
which will guide you through the deployment process.

There is also a compatibility list for many collective management organizations. If your
CMO or combination of CMOs is not supported, you can use the next method.

Direct Deployment
+++++++++++++++++

First, you need to sign up with `Heroku <https://heroku.com>`_ and/or log in.
Then press `here <https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/matijakolaric-com/django-music-publisher/tree/20.7>`_.
This will deploy the latest code in |version| branch.

You will be taken directly to the deployment form. Please note that you must fill the form correctly, or
Django-Music-Publisher will not be deployed. This is by design.

See `Settings`_ for more information.

Other options - manual deployment (developers or system engineers)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Django-Music-Publisher is based on Django, which can be installed on Windows,
Mac and Linux PCs and servers. For more information, consult the official
`Deploying Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/deployment/>`_ documentation.

Installing as Python package (developers only)
===================================================================

If you plan to use Django-Music-Publisher as one of the apps in your Django project, there is nothing special about it::

    pip install --upgrade django_music_publisher

Add ``music_publisher.apps.MusicPublisherConfig`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``. Almost everything goes
through the Django Admin. The only exception is royalty calculation, which has to be added to
``urls.py``

.. code:: python

    from music_publisher.royalty_calculation import RoyaltyCalculationView

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        path('royalty_calculation/', RoyaltyCalculationView.as_view(), name='royalty_calculation'),
    ]

There are several required `settings`_.
