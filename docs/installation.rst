Installation / Deployment and Configuration
*******************************************

Django-Music-Publisher can be installed/deployed as a stand-alone application, or used as a Python package.

Installing as Python package (developers only)
===================================================================

If you plan to use Django-Music-Publisher as one of the apps in your Django project, there is nothing special about it::

    pip install --upgrade django_music_publisher

Add ``music_publisher.apps.MusicPublisherConfig`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``, no URLs need to be added, as everything goes
through the Django Admin.

See `Settings`_.


Standalone Deployment
=====================

Depending on your needs and technical knowledge, there are several options here. They are listed below, starting with
the simplest option.

Deployment to Heroku (free tier)
--------------------------------

  Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps â€” we're the fastest way to go
  from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.

Django-Music-Publisher can simply be deployed to a Free dyno (container) on Heroku with a free database with up to
10.000 rows. Depending on complexity of your metadata, this is enough for 500-1.000 musical works.

If you need more, plans costing between $9 and $16 per months will increase the limits to hundreds of thousands of
works. If you ever need more, this will no longer be the right software anyway.

See https://www.heroku.com/pricing for details.

You will have to sign up with Heroku at https://signup.heroku.com/ and verify your e-mail,
no payment information is required.

There are two ways to do it:

* Guided deployment, which uses a wizard that helps you fill out the deployment form, and
* Direct deployment, which does not, but takes you directly to the deployment form.

Guided Deployment to Heroku
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The author and maintainer of Django-Music-Publisher runs a
`professional support service <https://matijakolaric.com/dmp-prosupport/>`_,
providing automatic feature upgrades, security/bugfix updates, maintenance and user support.

It also provides a free (no registration required)
`pre-installation wizard <https://matijakolaric.com/dmp-preinstallation/>`_ that fills out the deployment
form on Heroku. However, you can only select collecting societies (PROs, MROs, etc.) where batch registration
process and rules compatibility with Django-Music-Publisher has been verified.

Direct Deployment
+++++++++++++++++

.. raw:: html

    <p>First, you need to sign up with <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> and/or log in.
    Then press
    <a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/matijakolaric-com/django-music-publisher/tree/20">here</a>.</p>

You will be taken directly to the deployment form. Please note that you must fill the form correctly, or
Django-Music-Publisher will not be deployed. This is by design.

See `Settings`_.

Other options - manual deployment
----------------------------------

Django-Music-Publisher is based on Django, which can be installed on Windows,
Mac and Linux PCs and servers. For more information, consult the official
`Deploying Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/deployment/>`_ documentation.
