Importing CWR Acknowledgements
==============================

Societies or the agencies that handle CWR registrations for them will send acknowledgement files, which are also in a CWR format. You may receive more than one acknowledgement file for every CWR file you delivered. 

Importing CWR acknowledgement files into Django Music Publisher is very simple, just select ``Add`` in the ``CWR ACK import``, choose the file and save. A brief report will be shown, and there will be an additional line in ``Change Work views`` for every work in question.

Dealing with issues is not covered by this user manual, you must consult the official CWR documentation as well as inquiry with your society.

The maintainer of this project has made two tools freely available that may assist you in this process:

* `ACK Tool <https://matijakolaric.com/free/cwr-x-ack-tool>`_ that creates summaries of CWR acknowledgement files

* `CWR Syntax Highlighter <https://matijakolaric.com/free/cwr-syntax-highlighter/>`_ that adds syntax highlighting to uploaded acknowledgement files

Please note that acknowledgement files differ greatly from one society to the next, which makes it hard to create a general tool.
