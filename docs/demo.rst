Demo and Commercial Hosting Service
###################################

Demo
===============================================================================

A demo is available with several works. There are two versions, the US and the 
World version. The differences are subtle, but crucial. The US demo allows for 
multple entities affiliated with different PROs, while the world version does
not, but features society-assigned agreement numbers.

No registration is required to use the demos. For both use the following credentials:

* Username: ``demo``
* Password: ``demo``
